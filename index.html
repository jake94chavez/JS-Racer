<h1>JavaScript Racer</h1>
<p>Instructions: For this game the objective is simple. Get to the finish line! The first player to get to the finish line (the white line) wins! Player 1 (the top racer) presses the right arrow key to advance their racecar and Player 2 (the bottom racer) uses the "D" key. Good luck, and may the faster racer win!</p>
<p>Note: For the best experience play in fullscreen!</p>
